		<Text>Pre-B Cell Acute lymphocytic Leukaemia (ALL) (Also known as Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. ALL is characterised by an overproduction of immature white blood cells, called lymphoblasts or leukaemic blasts. Because the bone marrow is unable to make adequate numbers of red cells, normal white cells and platelets, people with ALL become more susceptible to anaemia, recurrent infections, and to bruising and bleeding easily. In between 75-80% of adult cases, ALL arises in B-lymphocytes in the early stages of development in the bone marrow. The disease is therefore called precursor B-cell ALL or Pre-B-cell ALL.</Text>

This type of ALL is less common accounting for around 3-5% of all adult cases. The hallmark of mature B-cell ALL is the presence of surface immunoglobulin on the lymphoblasts. Using conventional regimens, only 30-40% of patients enter complete remission (CR) and few patients survive long term.</Text>

		<Text>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)(Stable) is a type of slow-growing leukaemia that affects developing B-lymphocytes. B lymphocytes (also known as B-cells) are specialised white blood cells. Under normal conditions they produce immunoglobulins (also called antibodies) that help protect our bodies against infection and disease. In people with CLL, lymphocytes undergo a malignant (cancerous) change and become leukaemic cells. It is important to emphasise that for many people CLL remains stable for many months and years and has little, if any, impact on their lifestyle or general health. Around 30-50% of people diagnosed with CLL never require any treatment for their disease and can survive for many years despite their diagnosis. Because CLL develops slowly many people don’t have any symptoms, particularly in the early stages, and the disease is picked up during a routine blood test.</Text>

		<Text>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)(Advanced)(Rare) is a type of slow-growing leukaemia that affects developing B-lymphocytes. B lymphocytes (also known as B-cells) are specialised white blood cells. Under normal conditions they produce immunoglobulins (also called antibodies) that help protect our bodies against infection and disease. In people with CLL, lymphocytes undergo a malignant (cancerous) change and become leukaemic cells.

		<Text>T-Cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukaemia is a type of chronic leukaemia affecting white blood cells called "lymphocytes." Lymphocytes are part of the body's immune system and help fight certain infections. LGL leukemia is characterized by enlarged lymphocytes, containing noticeable granules, which can be seen when the blood is examined under the microscope. There are two types of LGL leukemia: T-cell (T-LGL) and natural killer cell (NK-LGL). The frequency of T-cell and NK-cell LGL leukaemia ranges from 2 to 5 percent. T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia is a clonal proliferation of cytotoxic T cells, which causes neutropenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia. This condition is often associated with autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis, and other lymphoproliferative disorders.</Text>

		<Text>T-cell prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) is an extremely rare and typically aggressive malignancy (cancer) that is characterized by the out of control growth of mature T-cells (T-lymphocytes). T-cells are a type of white blood cell that protects the body from infections. T-PLL affects older adults with a median age at diagnosis of 61 years, and it is more common in men than in women. Abnormal changes (mutations) in the genes of a T-cell can cause a normal, healthy T-cell to become a cancer cell. These genetic errors in the mutated T-cell tell the cell to keep growing and dividing when a healthy cell would typically stop dividing and eventually die. Every cell that arises from the initial leukemia cell also has the same mutated DNA. As a result, over time the number of leukaemia cells multiply and can travel in the blood to other sites including the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and sometimes skin.</Text>

		<Text>Acute Myeloid Leukaemia develops when the body makes too many immature white blood cells known as myeloid blast cells, also called myeloblasts. The myeloblasts multiply out of control and continue to divide but never mature into normal cells.  The abnormal blast cells are known as leukaemia cells. Because the leukaemia cells are immature and abnormal, they don’t carry out the usual infection-fighting function of white blood cells. They also crowd out normal white blood cells, which then can’t work properly. This increases the risk of infections.</Text>

They also spill out of the bone marrow and circulate around the body in the bloodstream. Because they are not fully mature, they are unable to work properly to fight infections. Over time, a shortage of red cells and platelets can cause anaemia, bleeding and/or bruising. Overall, CML is a rare disease, accounting for around 0.03% of all cancers diagnosed.

Ductal means that the cancer starts inside the milk ducts, carcinoma refers to any cancer that begins in the skin or other tissues (including breast tissue) that cover or line the internal organs, and in situ means "in its original place." DCIS is called "non-invasive" because it hasn’t spread beyond the milk duct into any normal surrounding breast tissue. DCIS isn’t life-threatening, but having DCIS can increase the risk of developing an invasive breast cancer later on. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) means that there are too many cells and they have the features of cancer, but they are still confined to the inside of the duct. Although it is rare, men can develop breast cancer. \n\nDCIS generally has no signs or symptoms.</Text>

		<Text>Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), sometimes called infiltrating ductal carcinoma, is the most common type of breast cancer. About 80% of all breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. Invasive means that the cancer has “invaded” or spread to the surrounding breast tissues. Ductal means that the cancer began in the milk ducts, which are the “pipes” that carry milk from the milk-producing lobules to the nipple. Carcinoma refers to any cancer that begins in the skin or other tissues that cover internal organs — such as breast tissue. All together, “invasive ductal carcinoma” refers to cancer that has broken through the wall of the milk duct and begun to invade the tissues of the breast. Over time, invasive ductal carcinoma can spread to the lymph nodes and possibly to other areas of the body. Although it is rare, men can develop breast cancer. \n\nAt first, invasive ductal carcinoma may not cause any symptoms.</Text>

Cancer cells can break away from the original tumour in the breast and travel to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system, which is a large network of nodes and vessels that works to remove bacteria, viruses, and cellular waste products. Breast cancer can come back in another part of the body months or years after the original diagnosis and treatment.

		<Text>Mantle cell lymphoma is a relatively uncommon type of lymphoma, accounting for approximately 5% to 10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It affects the outer edge (mantle zone) of B-cells in the lymph node follicle. In 85% of cases, an abnormality occurs when two chromosomes (11 and 14) break and join together with each other. This is called a ‘translocation’ and causes B-cells to over-produce a protein called cyclin D1. In usual quantities, Cyclin D1 helps to promote normal cell growth, with excess amounts resulting in uncontrolled growth of mantle zone cells which can lead to MCL.</Text>

		<Text>Large cell carcinoma of the lungs is a form of non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancers account for 80 percent of lung cancers, and of these, roughly 10 percent are large cell carcinoma of the lung. ﻿Unlike some lung cancers that more commonly present with a cough or lung infections, early symptoms often include a vague sense of shortness of breath and fatigue. Large cell carcinomas are also called large cell lung cancers. They are named for the appearance of large round cells when examined under the microscope, although the tumours themselves tend to be large as well when diagnosed. Large cell carcinomas often occur in the outer regions of the lungs, and tend to grow rapidly and spread more quickly than some other forms of non-small cell lung cancer.</Text>

Lung cancer typically doesn't cause signs and symptoms in its earliest stages. Signs and symptoms of lung cancer typically occur only when the disease is advanced. \n\nWith cancer that is detected early, the cancer is usually found only in the tissue or organ where it began, and has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body.</Text>
